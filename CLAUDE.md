# Global Claude Guidelines

## Constraints

### No Co-Authored-By Footer (2026-01-15)

**Guideline**: Never add `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>` or any AI attribution to commit messages.

### Concise Commit Messages (2026-01-15)

**Guideline**: Keep commit messages concise - prefer one-line summaries. Avoid verbose multi-line bodies unless absolutely necessary.

## Best Practices

### Task Tracking with backlog.md (2026-01-15)

**Guideline**: Create `backlog.md` in project root for task tracking. Use this to track upcoming work, priorities, and project roadmap.

## User Preferences

### Testing Email Recipients
When testing emails, only send to Jamie's addresses:
- `jamie.laevatin@gmail.com`
- `jamieli98909@gmail.com`

Never send test emails to other users in the database.

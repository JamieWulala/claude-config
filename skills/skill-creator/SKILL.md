# Skill Creator

This skill provides guidance for creating effective skills.

## About Skills

Skills are modular, self-contained packages that extend Claude's capabilities by providing specialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as "onboarding guides" for specific domains or tasks—they transform Claude from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent equipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.

### What Skills Provide

1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains
2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs
3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic
4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks

## Core Principles

### Concise is Key

The context window is a public good. Skills share the context window with everything else Claude needs: system prompt, conversation history, other Skills' metadata, and the actual user request.

**Default assumption: Claude is already very smart.** Only add context Claude doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: "Does Claude really need this explanation?" and "Does this paragraph justify its token cost?"

Prefer concise examples over verbose explanations.

### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom

Match the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability:

**High freedom (text-based instructions)**: Use when multiple approaches are valid, decisions depend on context, or heuristics guide the approach.

**Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters)**: Use when a preferred pattern exists, some variation is acceptable, or configuration affects behavior.

**Low freedom (specific scripts, few parameters)**: Use when operations are fragile and error-prone, consistency is critical, or a specific sequence must be followed.

Think of Claude as exploring a path: a narrow bridge with cliffs needs specific guardrails (low freedom), while an open field allows many routes (high freedom).

### Anatomy of a Skill

Every skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required)
│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)
│   │   ├── name: (required)
│   │   └── description: (required)
│   └── Markdown instructions (required)
└── Bundled Resources (optional)
    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)
    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed
    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)
```

#### SKILL.md (required)

Every SKILL.md consists of:

- **Frontmatter** (YAML): Contains `name` and `description` fields. These are the only fields that Claude reads to determine when the skill gets used, thus it is very important to be clear and comprehensive in describing what the skill is, and when it should be used.
- **Body** (Markdown): Instructions and guidance for using the skill. Only loaded AFTER the skill triggers (if at all).

#### Bundled Resources (optional)

##### Scripts (`scripts/`)

Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.

- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed
- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks
- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context
- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Claude for patching or environment-specific adjustments

##### References (`references/`)

Documentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Claude's process and thinking.

- **When to include**: For documentation that Claude should reference while working
- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template
- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies
- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Claude determines it's needed
- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md

##### Assets (`assets/`)

Files not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.

- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output
- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates
- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts

#### What to Not Include in a Skill

A skill should only contain essential files. Do NOT create:
- README.md
- INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md
- QUICK_REFERENCE.md
- CHANGELOG.md

### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle

Skills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:

1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)
2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)
3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Claude (Unlimited)

Keep SKILL.md body to the essentials and under 500 lines. Split content into separate files when approaching this limit.

**Pattern 1: High-level guide with references**

```markdown
# PDF Processing

## Quick start
[code example]

## Advanced features
- **Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for complete guide
- **API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for all methods
```

**Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization**

```
bigquery-skill/
├── SKILL.md (overview and navigation)
└── reference/
    ├── finance.md
    ├── sales.md
    └── product.md
```

## Skill Creation Process

Follow these steps in order:

### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples

To create an effective skill, understand concrete examples of how it will be used:

- "What functionality should the skill support?"
- "Can you give examples of how this skill would be used?"
- "What would a user say that should trigger this skill?"

### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents

Analyze each example to identify:
1. What scripts would be helpful for repetitive operations
2. What references would inform the process
3. What assets would be used in the output

### Step 3: Initializing the Skill

When creating a new skill from scratch, run the `init_skill.py` script:

```bash
scripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>
```

The script creates a template skill directory with SKILL.md and example resource directories.

### Step 4: Edit the Skill

#### Learn Proven Design Patterns

Consult these guides based on your skill's needs:
- **Multi-step processes**: See references/workflows.md for sequential and conditional workflows
- **Output formats**: See references/output-patterns.md for template and example patterns

#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents

Begin implementation with `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Test added scripts by actually running them.

#### Update SKILL.md

**Writing Guidelines:** Always use imperative/infinitive form.

##### Frontmatter

Write the YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`:

- `name`: The skill name (hyphen-case)
- `description`: The primary triggering mechanism. Include both what the Skill does and specific triggers/contexts for when to use it.

Do not include any other fields in YAML frontmatter.

##### Body

Write instructions for using the skill and its bundled resources.

### Step 5: Packaging a Skill

Once development is complete, package into a distributable .skill file:

```bash
scripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> [output-directory]
```

The script validates then packages the skill. If validation fails, fix errors and run again.

### Step 6: Iterate

After testing, iterate based on real usage:

1. Use the skill on real tasks
2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies
3. Identify updates needed
4. Implement changes and test again
